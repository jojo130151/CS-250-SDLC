How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  First, there needs to be an understanding of what the user needs/wants from their program from communicating with them. Once the requirements are garthered from the client, they get broken down into easy-to-read and manageable user stories. These user staories break up the system and all of its required features into meassurable tasks that need to be accomplished. They are also in a language that both the developer and client can understand so that everyone is on the same page about the project.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  I enjoyed learning about Scrum and all of its benefits this term. The Scrum approach to projects involves a small team that communicates daily, helps each other out, and completes task during an iterative process throughout the project. Agile is also great about adapting to changes and doing only a little bit of documentation upfront before the project starts developing. This is definelty something I can get behind because I know that there will always be change, whether from the client or higher-up management, something will derail and try to disrupt the project.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Communcation throughout the project and thourough documentation. Communication is key. There is a reason that that is such a popular phrase. It is so important for your team to know your progress, any problems you are having, something you noticed about the project, how something could be improved, where you see redundency, etc. Open communication is what will drive a team towards success. I also listed thorough documentation because, in a sense, it is another form of communication with your team mates as well as future people that may work on this project. It is what will be refereneced to help people in the future and it is a good form of communication and productiveness to provide them with a well thought out document.
